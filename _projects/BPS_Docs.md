# BeVolt BPS Documentation Contributions 

I'm working with students at the University of Texas at Austin to document a Battery Protection System they're working on for a solar powered race car. 
The car will be used to compete in the American Solar Challenge. 

I've advised them to move their docs from a shared Google Docs document to ReadTheDocs and we're currently moving their documentation over to RST format.
